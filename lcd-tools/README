# lcd tools

## Introduction
lcd tools is a demo. It use bitbang driver to display simple strings on a 1602 LCD device.

It maybe run on any Linux OS. I use Raspberry Pi 1 Model B for testing.

The LCD is usually attach a 8-bit I/O expander with IIC bus interface

(pcf8574 or pcf8574a like device). So we can use just two wire to operate the device.

## How to use it ?
### Preparation
Raspberry Pi 1 Model B x 1, 

IIC LCD x 1 (http://yourduino.com/sunshop2/index.php?l=product_detail&p=170), 

and some wires.

### Configure the hardware

SCL_PIN <---> GPIO_27

SDA_PIN <---> GPIO_17

Don't foget connect +5V and GND.

You can find the pin from here: http://elinux.org/RPi_Low-level_peripherals

### Go
Init LCD: lcd-tools -i

Display strings: lcd-tools -s "lcd\ntools"

Turn on/off: lcd-tools -c 1 or lcd-tools -c 1

Help: lcd-tools -h

Note:

The default IIC address for LCD is 39, so if you want to change it, 

then set the IIC_LCD_ADDR environment variable as you want, It only 

support decimal string. 

eg: IIC_LCD_ADDR=16 lcd-tools -i

If you cann't find the address, you can use i2c-tools to find it.
